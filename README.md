Bib-reader. John Grogan, 2020

This site will analyse the bibliography from an article you are writing, and suggest journals to submit to, and reviewers to suggest, based on the frequency of their appearance.

Please copy your bibliography into the box, check the boxes saying which information you want, and hit submit. 

You can submit your bibliography in APA style, or directly from a BibTex file, just make sure each you select the right option from the dropdown menu.

You can also choose the minimum frequency to display (e.g. select 2 to ignore those you only cite once, or 1 to show all).

And you can change how we match authors - we can match by surname only, surname and first or all initials, or surname and first or all names. 

It will rank all the journals and authors you have cited by their frequency, to give you ideas for submissions and reviewers.
